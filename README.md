# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to create supervised machine learning models that would help to predict credit risk. To do this, imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries were used to build and evaluate models using resampling. Specifically, oversampling was conducted using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, undersampling using the ClusterCentroids algorithm and a combination approach using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Finally, two new machine learning models, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, were leveraged to predict credit risk.
